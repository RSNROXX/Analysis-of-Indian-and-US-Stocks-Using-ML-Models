# Analysis-of-Indian-and-US-Stocks-Using-ML-Models
Final Year Project - This project is about an analysis of 2 stocks namely, NIFTY and NASDAQ and their impact on each other. Also with the help of Machine Learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest, we access the models performances. 

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the correlation between NASDAQ (US) and NIFTY (India) indices. To ensure modularity and clear comparison, the analysis is split into separate notebooks for each Machine Learning model, namely: 
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest 

## File Guide
* **LinearRegression_NASDAQ.ipynb**: Implementation of the Linear Regression model for trend prediction for Nasdaq Stock.
* **LinearRegression_NIFTY.ipynb**: Implementation of the Linear Regression model for trend prediction for Nifty Stock.
* **DecisionTree_NASDAQ.ipynb**: Analysis using the Decision Tree regressor for Nasdaq Stock.
* **DecisionTree_NIFTY.ipynb**: Analysis using the Decision Tree regressor for Nifty Stock.
* **RandomForest_NASDAQ.ipynb**: Implementation of the Random Forest algorithm for Nasdaq Stock.
* **RandomForest_NIFTY.ipynb**: Implementation of the Random Forest algorithm for Nifty Stock.
* **model_comparison.ipynb**: Side-by-side performance metrics and visualization of all three models.

## Key Findings
The comparison revealed that **Random Forest** provided the most robust predictions. The project identified a correlation coefficient of **0.720** between the US and Indian markets.
